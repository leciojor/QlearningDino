## Disclamer

This project was not fully finished since none of the models trained are working as expected. I also pretend to add a docker file or something in the future to make the process of running the application more intuitive. Please, do not base my general software development skills on this project, this was intended to aid my learning and develop my reinforcement learning skills learning. The academic paper of this project can be found in the root directory of the repo
